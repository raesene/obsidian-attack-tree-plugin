# Attack Tree Plugin for Obsidian

This is a vibecoded Obsidian plugin which enables you to add attack trees based the [Deciduous](https://github.com/rpetrich/deciduous) project by Ryan Petrich and Kelly Shortridge, implemented to make it easier to store and visualize attack trees.

## Installation

1. Copy the project folder into your vault's `.obsidian/plugins` directory.
2. Go to settings --> Community plugins
3. Refresh the "Installed Plugins" list
4. Activate the "Attack Tree plugin"

## Creating an attack tree

On the toolbar on the left of the vault, you should see the "attack tree plugin" button, click that to create a new attack tree. For details on how to use Deciduous, see [Kelly's blog](https://kellyshortridge.com/blog/posts/deciduous-attack-tree-app/).

## Limitations

- At the moment the attack trees are always created in the root of the vault, but you can move them to a folder after creation.
- The theming isn't perfect but `classic` and `dark` work fine.


An Obsidian plugin that allows you to create and visualize attack trees using YAML files in the deciduous format. This plugin provides a rich, interactive interface for security analysis and threat modeling.

## Development

Built using:
- Claude Code
- TypeScript
- Obsidian Plugin API
- Deciduous attack tree engine
- Graphviz for visualization
- js-yaml for YAML parsing
